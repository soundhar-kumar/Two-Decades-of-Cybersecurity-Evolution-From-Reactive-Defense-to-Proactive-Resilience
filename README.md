## Overview

This research project analyzes the transformative journey of cybersecurity over the past 25 years, documenting the evolution from primarily reactive defense postures to proactive resilience frameworks. The study introduces the **Cyber Defense Evolution Model (CDEM)** to map this critical transition and its implications for future cybersecurity paradigms.

## Abstract

The research examines how cybersecurity has undergone a profound metamorphosis from rudimentary, reactive measures to sophisticated, AI-driven proactive strategies. It highlights key shifts in strategy, technology, and organizational approaches, focusing on the evolution from traditional perimeter defense models to advanced security frameworks.
